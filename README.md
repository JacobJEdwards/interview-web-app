# Interview Web App

A simple web app created as a proof of concept for the Project Management System Internship Interview.

Consists of an Express RESTful API written in TypeScript, and a Remix.run react client.

TODO: Finish

- A student should be able to select a project
- Might need to add endpoints -> student id module id -> projetcs (might already be added)
- sort out the typing
- eventually submission

- need to sort out selection logic look at the endpoints (query or params)
