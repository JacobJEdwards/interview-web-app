A simple web app created as a proof of concept for the Project Management System Internship Interview.

Consists of an Express RESTful API written in TypeScript, and a Remix.run react client.

TODO: Finish

- Modules should not be able to be added to or changed from this site
- A student should be able to just view projects (currently)
- A teacher should be able to preform crud operations on the projects (associated with a module)
- Each module could be a link -> dynamic routes per project
